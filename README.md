# EcoRev
An app that will monitor a car to make it accelerate at an eco friendly pace. 

The slider simulates the throttle of a car. 
The LCD screen displays current speed at km/h.


Move the slider up to accelerate. Do not release the click when you drag the slider as holding it continues the timer to calculate time for acceleration calculation. 
Wiggle the knob of the slider at the desired location to refresh the LCD screen. The text box will display a warning if you are applying too much throttle (accelerating too fast).
Release your click on the slider to reset acceleration and speed.
